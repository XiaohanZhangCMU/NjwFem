The PaStiX team recommands you to get Scotch (\url{http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/scotch/}) and compile it.

Go into the main PaStiX directory and select the config file corresponding to your machine in PASTIX_DIR/config/ and copy it to PASTIX_DIR/config.in.

Edit this file, select the options you want, and set the correct path for SCOTCH_HOME. If you want to use METIS, you also have to compile it and edit the path.

Execute :

 - make help       print this help
 - make all        build PaStiX library in optimized compilation mode
 - make debug      build PaStiX library in debug mode
 - make drivers    build matrix drivers library
 - make examples   build examples
 - make murge      build murge examples
 - make clean      remove all binaries and objects directories
 - make cleanall   remove all binaries, objects and dependancies directories

remark : murge examples are only available in distributed mode (PaStiX compiled with -DDISTRIBUTED)

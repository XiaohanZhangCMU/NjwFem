Affect memory area for the \texttt{schur}
}{
Using this fonction, the user provides a memory area for the storage
of the schur.\\
The memory area must be of size $nSchurLocalcol \times nSchurCol$,
where \texttt{nSchurLocalcol} is the number of local columns required
for the \texttt{MPI} node and \texttt{nSchurCol} is the global number
of columns of the \texttt{schur} (and row since the schur is a
square).\\
This function as to be called after analysis step and before numerical
factorization is performed.\\
After the factorization, the \texttt{schur} column $schurLocalColumn[i]$ will be stored
from $schurArray[i\times nSchurCol]$
to $schurArray[(i+1)\times nSchurCol - 1]$.}

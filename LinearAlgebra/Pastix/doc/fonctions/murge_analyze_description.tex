  Perform matrix analyze:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compute a new ordering of the unknows
  \item Compute the symbolic factorisation of the matrix
  \item Distribute column blocks and computation on processors
  \end{itemize}

  This function is not needed to use Murge interface, it only forces 
  analyze step when user wants.
  
  If this function is not used, analyze step will be performed 
  when getting new distribution from MURGE, or filling the matrix.

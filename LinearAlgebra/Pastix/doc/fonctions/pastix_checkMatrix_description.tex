  %% description longue
  Check and correct the user matrix in CSC format~:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Renumbers in Fortran numerotation (base 1) if needed (base 0)
   \item Can scale the matrix if compiled with \texttt{-DMC64 -DSCALING} (untested)
   \item Checks the symetry of the graph in non symmetric mode.
     With non distributed matrices, with $flagcor == API\_YES$, 
     tries to correct the matrix.
   \item sort the CSC.
  \end{itemize}


  In fortran, with correction enable, CSC array can be reallocated.\\
  \pastix{} works on a copy of the CSC and stores it internaly if the
  number of entries changed.\\
  If the number of entries changed ($colptr[n]-1$), user as to
  reallocate rows and avals and then call
  PASTIX\_FORTRAN\_CHECKMATRIX\_END().

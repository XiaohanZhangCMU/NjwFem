Return the list of local schur unkowns. 
}{
Return the list of unkowns of the schur complement which will be stored
on the current \texttt{MPI} process.\\
This knowledge is necessary for the user to interpret the part of the
schur stored in the memory allocation he provides
with \texttt{pastix\_setSchurArray} (\ref{proto:pastix_setSchurArray}).\\
This function can't be called before analysis step and user must have
called \texttt{pastix\_getSchurLocalUnkownNbr}
(\ref{proto:pastix_getSchurLocalUnkownNbr}) to be aware of the size of the
unkown list.}
